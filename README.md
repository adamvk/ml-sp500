Hobby project - Using machine learning to try to forecast the SP500 stock index.

Currently using 4 input features to predict the closing price of the following day. The features are:
- Closing price
- Volume
- Daily high
- Daily low

Note: This is a work-in-progress and not in any way a final product.
